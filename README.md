# notes app ðŸ“’

just a simple notes app i made to further learn react

## what it does

- add notes with titles and descriptions
- categorize them (work, personal, ideas)
- set priorities (high, medium, low)
- delete notes when you're done
- looks pretty decent with dark mode

## how to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## techstack

react + vite + tailwind

nothing fancy, just works(hopefully)
